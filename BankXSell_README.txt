
 BankXSell Cross-Selling Analytics Project

Intern Project | JPCB Bank, Jalgaon | MySQL ,Power BI 

This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at JPCB Bank, focusing on uncovering cross-selling opportunities by analyzing customer data, transaction behavior, and branch performance using a simulated banking dataset. I built interactive Power BI dashboards using data modeled in MySQL and transformed via Power Query and DAX.

Tools & Technologies
- MySQL Workbench (Database schema and querying)
- Power BI (Dashboard and visual reporting)
- Power Query (ETL and data transformation)
- DAX (Business calculations and KPIs)
- Excel (Dummy data creation)

Dataset Details
-Created using MySQL Workbench
-15 tables with approx. 50 rows each
-Dummy dataset designed based on typical banking entities:
        Customers, Products, Transactions, Branches, Insurance, Loans, Channel Usage, etc.

Project Objectives
- Segment customers by value and behavior to identify cross-sell opportunities
- Analyze product penetration for financial products like Loans, FDs, and Insurance
- Track service usage (MobileApp, NetBanking) to promote digital offerings
- Identify dormant accounts for re-engagement
- Assess branch-wise performance to drive regional marketing

Implemented Dashboards & Key Analyses

1. Customer Product Penetration & Cross-Sell Matrix
- Compared product usage across High, Mid, and Low-Value customers
- Found underutilized loan and FD products among High-Value segments

2. Life Event-Based Offers
- Identified customers getting married or inquiring about loans/accounts
- Recommended timely products like health insurance or joint accounts

3. Loan Cross-Sell Score Dashboard
- Built eligibility logic for loan offers based on balance & transactions
- Generated list of candidates for pre-approved loan campaigns

4. Insurance Gap Funnel
- Detected that 23.3% of loan holders lacked insurance
- Designed funnel to target these for credit life or health insurance

5. Branch-Wise Product Engagement
- Pune showed high product usage per customer; Jalgaon underperformed despite highest branch count

6. Dormant Product Analysis
- Found 187 dormant customers with savings or FD accounts
- Recommended reactivation campaigns with personalized incentives

7. Channel Usage vs Cross-Sell Score
- NetBanking and MobileApp were most used, especially by Class B users
- Proposed promoting SIPs and digital FDs through these platforms



Key Insights Summary
* Product Penetration: High-value customers hold fewer FDs and Loans than expected—strong potential for targeted outreach.
* Branch Performance: Pune branches show high product engagement (Avg = 10), while Jalgaon is underperforming (Avg = 0).
* Insurance Gap: 23.3% of loan customers are uninsured—key opportunity for insurance upselling.
* Dormant Analysis: 187 dormant customers—ideal for reactivation offers.
* Channel Preference: NetBanking & MobileApp users dominate—potential to promote digital products over ATM-based ones.
